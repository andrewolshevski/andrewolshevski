            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm an education-focused product leader with 10+ years experience building platforms and experiences that help people learn better.</p>
            
            <p>I've done a bit of everything, but specialize in assessment technology, LMS, student retention, and experiential learning.</p>
            
            <p>I started my career as an English/French instructor, and that teaching foundation still drives how I build: always starting at the end from learning outcomes, grounding it in the reality of students' lived experience, then using technology to amplify what works.</p>
            
            <p>I live in Brooklyn with my wife & son and never miss an Eagles game (go birds).</p>

            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>Presently, I work as a product consultant for <a href="https://drivexlabs.com/" target="_blank"><strong>DriveX Labs</strong></a>, helping emerging edtech startups grow user retention, outcomes, and LTV.</p>
            
            <p>Previously, I worked on learner experience at <a href="https://emeritus.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Emeritus</strong></a> from Feb 2022 - June 2025. I reduced bootcamp dropout rates by 50% and introduced AI-powered assessments that increased learner engagement by as much as 3x while reducing average feedback time from days to seconds.</p>
            
            <p>In 2024, I also held a fractional leadership role as Head of Ops at <a href="https://www.bps.community/" target="_blank"><strong>Brooklyn Psychedelic Society</strong></a>, where I built out the core operational infrastructure (budgeting, reporting, financial model), optimized the event programming strategy for community growth, and secured 501(c)(3) nonprofit status.</p>
            
            <p>Before all of that, from 2014-2022, I cut my teeth at <a href="https://www.cricketelearning.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Fluent City</strong></a>. I started as a part-time French teacher, then earned a sequence of promotions to increasingly strategic roles. As Senior Enrollment Advisor, I sold & managed custom B2B training programs. Then, as Manager of Talent & Culture, I scaled our best-in-class experience to 4 U.S. cities + online, managing a staff of 200+ instructors. Finally, as Head of Product, I built our learning platform and helped lead the company to successful acquisition in 2021.</p>
